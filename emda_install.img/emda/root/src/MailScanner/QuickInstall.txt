Mailscanner quick install notes

2008-10-01

This describes the steps necessary to install MailScanner on
Red Hat and CentOS systems, and many other Linux systems.
This can be done by running the install.sh
script from the MailScanner distribution.


Install sequence

1. Install MailScanner package, by running the "./install.sh" script
   contained in the distribution directory. The "README" file will tell
   you of some advanced options you can use with this if you want to
   install it faster or if you hit any problems.

2. Install one or more supported anti-virus packages. Virtually all Unix
   anti-virus packages are supported.

3. You may need to edit the file /etc/MailScanner/virus.scanners.conf
   to set the installation directory you used for your virus scanners.
   You will be able to find this out by running "MailScanner --lint"
   and reading the output to see if all your virus scanners correctly
   spotted the test. MailScanner should automatically find all the
   anti-virus packages you have installed.

4. Download and install the easy-to-install ClamAV & SpamAssassin package
   from the Downloads page on www.MailScanner.info.

5. Stop any old versions of MailScanner by running

    service MailScanner stop

6. Check your configuration by running

    MailScanner --lint

7. Stop and disable your original sendmail setup. To do this,

    service sendmail stop
    chkconfig sendmail off

8. Enable and start your new MailScanner setup. To do this,

    chkconfig MailScanner on
    service MailScanner restart
