Welcome to MailScanner version 4.

To install MailScanner, run the "install.sh" script in this directory
with a command
	./install.sh

If this has great problems installing the Perl modules, you might
find it easier to install the Perl modules by hand and then come
back here and run "./install.sh" again to finish off.

Note that you will need a C compiler (gcc) installed before you
can install the Perl modules. If you aren't sure, type "which gcc"
and see if it tells you where it is installed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependency Problems?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If the RPM "mailscanner" won't install happily, then you could do
	./install.sh nodeps
and it will ignore the fact that the Perl modules were not installed
using RPM commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Taking too long?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are pretty confident everything is going to work, you can
speed it up by using the command
	./install fast
Everything will still happen as normal, it just will not wait for
you to have a chance to read all the progress output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Still can't get it to install?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get really stuck, subscribe to the mailing list (instructions
on the web at www.mailscanner.info) and ask for help, giving a
clear description of what you have done, what sort of system+version
you are running and where you are stuck.

In your posting, include the output of "MailScanner -v" and
"MailScanner --lint"
